# Third-party notices

This file records material incorporated into the AliasHub source distribution.
It is informational and does not replace the applicable license terms.

## FrciblyK12-derived registration worker

The source under `registration-worker/` is a modified derivative of
[FrciblyK12](https://github.com/sky3100/FrciblyK12), based on upstream commit
`6ad0e1e8dd889f9eb023dae25511cc58ce2caf2a`. Copyright in the upstream work
remains with the FrciblyK12 contributors.

FrciblyK12 is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.
The worker's license text is retained at `registration-worker/LICENSE`, its
provenance is recorded in `registration-worker/UPSTREAM.md`, and its complete
modified source is included in `registration-worker/`.

The upstream FrciblyK12 README also credits the plugin architecture of
`lxf746/any-auto-register`. AliasHub is derived from the pinned FrciblyK12
baseline rather than directly from that earlier repository; the upstream credit
is preserved in `registration-worker/README.md`.
