# Public release checklist

Use this checklist for the source repository and every downloadable archive.

## 1. Verify licensing and notices

AliasHub is released under `AGPL-3.0-only`. Keep the unmodified license text in
the root `LICENSE` file and include it in every source or binary distribution.
Keep `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` with distributed artifacts.

The bundled `registration-worker/` is a modified derivative of
[sky3100/FrciblyK12](https://github.com/sky3100/FrciblyK12). Preserve its
`LICENSE` and `UPSTREAM.md`, include its complete corresponding source, and do
not remove upstream attribution. Review dependency licenses whenever bundled
dependencies or generated binaries change.

The bundled `mail-pickup/` source and its dependency declarations must remain
in the release. Do not include its database, merchant session, proxy settings,
browser profile, inbound token, HMAC secret, or administrator credentials.

The bundled `payment-link-extractor/` source, templates, static assets, and
dependency declarations must also remain in the release. Do not include its
Access Tokens, task history, proxy pools, subscription URLs, logs, `.env`, or
virtual environment.

## 2. Remove deployment state

Confirm that the repository contains no:

- `.env` files other than `.env.example`;
- SQLite databases, attachments, logs, backups, browser profiles, or build
  artifacts;
- mailbox addresses or content, OAuth tokens/codes, session secrets, passwords,
  proxy credentials, connector keys, worker tokens, or SUB2 Admin API Keys;
- private hostnames, IP addresses, filesystem paths, service names, or production
  configuration.

Examples must use `example.com`, the RFC documentation address ranges, and
obvious placeholder credentials.

If a real credential was ever committed or included in an archive, rotate or
revoke it. Removing a file or rewriting history does not make the credential safe
to keep using.

## 3. Publish clean Git history

Do not push a development or production repository's existing history to a new
public remote. Old commits can retain deleted credentials and deployment data.

For the first public release, start from the reviewed clean tree and create a
fresh root commit, or use a reviewed history-rewrite procedure. Preserve the old
private repository separately. Inspect all branches, tags, pull-request refs,
Git LFS objects, releases, and CI artifacts before changing visibility.

## 4. Verify source and build

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run test:pickup
npm run build
(
  cd payment-link-extractor
  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
  python3 -c 'import ast,pathlib; [ast.parse(p.read_text(encoding="utf-8-sig"), filename=str(p)) for p in pathlib.Path(".").rglob("*.py")]'
)
PUBLIC_RELEASE_DENYLIST_FILE=/path/to/private-identifiers.txt \
  REQUIRE_LICENSE=1 CHECK_GIT_HISTORY=1 ./scripts/check-public-release.sh
```

If a release ZIP is needed:

```bash
npm run package:local
(cd release/local && sha256sum -c *.zip.sha256)
```

Extract the archive into a temporary directory and inspect it independently. Run
`scripts/check-public-release.sh` against the extracted directory as a final
content check.

The optional denylist is an untracked UTF-8 text file containing one literal
private hostname, address, account identifier, or other deployment marker per
line; blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are ignored. The bundled checker
catches those local identifiers, forbidden file types, and common token formats.
It is a release gate, not a complete secret detector. Review changes manually
and use an additional history-aware scanner such as Gitleaks in CI when
available.

## 5. Validate a clean installation

Test every supported path from a machine without the maintainer's `.env` or
database:

- core Docker Compose on loopback;
- full Docker Compose with the bundled registration worker and noVNC ports still
  bound to loopback, Mail Pickup on port `4190`, and the payment-link extractor
  on port `18794`;
- the documented remote HTTPS reverse-proxy setup.

Verify mailbox OAuth, inbox scanning, address generation, connector pairing,
backup/restore, Pickup publication/query flows, and upgrades. Test registration
with newly issued non-production fixtures. Verify DE/EUR, TR/USD, and GB/GBP
payment-link task creation with dedicated non-production proxy fixtures. Confirm
core mode remains fully usable without the worker, Pickup service, or extractor,
and that SUB2 remains disabled until each deployer supplies its own service URL
and Admin API Key.

## 6. Tag and publish

1. Update the version and release notes.
2. Commit the reviewed source tree.
3. Create a signed or annotated version tag.
4. Publish the source and checksummed artifacts.
5. Record supported upgrade paths and database migrations.
6. Keep private CI variables scoped, masked, protected, and revocable.
