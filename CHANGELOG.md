# Changelog

All notable changes to AliasHub are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added complete Checkout `cs_live`/`oaics` classification, cached Checkout URL
  reuse, account-level rate-limit cooldowns, and Japanese Plus trial detection.
- Added the Sales inventory page, registered-account Pickup publishing/status,
  and direct registered-account mailbox viewing.
- Added the complete standalone Mail Pickup service, buyer and administrator
  pages, compatible mailbox query API, inbound delivery, storefront automation,
  tests, Docker image, and Full Compose integration.
- Added direct PayPal billing-agreement link extraction for registered accounts,
  persistent task progress, independent Checkout and Update proxy pools, proxy
  rotation and subscription import, plus DE/EUR, TR/USD, and GB/GBP billing
  profiles.
- Added the complete payment-link extractor source, workbench, CLI, Docker image,
  and Full Compose integration so the direct-link flow is reproducible from a
  clean clone.
- Added registration-failure markers to the address inventory and registration
  selector, plus one-click filtered selection and guarded bulk deletion of failed
  addresses.
- Added selectable proxy routes for Access Token refresh, exact Plus activation
  time display and sorting, and deleted-account detection from account state and
  mailbox evidence.

### Changed

- Replaced deployment-specific Pickup domains, product IDs, image URLs, and
  account examples with environment-driven or documentation-only defaults.
- Full mode now starts AliasHub, the registration worker, Mail Pickup, and the
  payment-link extractor while preserving all runtime state under ignored `.env`
  and `data/` paths.

### Security

- Pickup publication never sends Access Tokens; source-address publication
  clears credentials, and repository checks exclude databases, credentials,
  browser profiles, private domains, and production configuration.
- Removed deployment-specific NFapi, Pickup, Google OAuth, mailbox-link, custom
  domain, proxy-account, and workspace fixtures from the published source. All
  deployment credentials and service endpoints now come from ignored local
  configuration or administrator settings.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Added pause, resume, and cancel-remaining controls in both AliasHub and the
  bundled worker, plus a persistent queue-wide pause that also holds newly
  submitted work and a queue-wide cancel action that preserves completed accounts.
- Added a mailbox-workspace page for binding `email + dispose.lol inbox link`
  rows and a matching ChatGPT registration source that allocates exactly one
  saved mailbox to each registration task.
- Added bundled-worker support for dispose.lol inbox-link message snapshots,
  new-message OTP polling, fixed-pool capacity checks, and per-task allocation.
- Added existing-account AT refresh through an authenticated web session or the
  original mailbox OTP login, deleted-account persistence, and a red `AT
  invalid` state in account and inbox-link views.
- Added independent registration and AT-recovery worker lanes, with AT recovery
  prioritized without bypassing per-account locking.
- Added local-account restoration from worker exports, JSON, JSONL, CSV, TXT,
  or email-only input, reconnecting retained registration and mailbox records.
- Added account email search, bulk group editing, OpenAI OAuth Refresh Token
  acquisition, and selected-account SUB2 and Refresh Token exports.
- Added a Git overwrite updater that backs up and verifies the root `.env`, the
  optional worker `.env`, AliasHub SQLite, attachments, worker data, and all
  other files under `data/` before rebuilding.

### Changed

- Synced the public web application and API with the complete account-operation
  interface while excluding only external pickup-store publishing.
- Removed deployment-specific NFapi defaults; compatible service and optional
  credential-reader connections now require explicit local configuration.

### Security

- Inbox-link keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM in AliasHub, masked in API and
  UI responses, and omitted from registration logs and public test fixtures.

[1.2.0]: https://github.com/1120393079/aliashub/releases/tag/v1.2.0

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Read-only Apple iCloud Mail support with encrypted App-specific passwords.
- Bundled Microsoft account registration runner, saved proxy management, and
  registration result ingestion.
- Registered-account availability and subscription-plan detection, automatic
  plan groups, and manual group overrides.
- Bulk SUB2-compatible imports through OpenAI OAuth or Ed25519 Agent Identity,
  including idempotent recovery and credential-state verification.
- Direct Microsoft base-address registration alongside the existing Plus-address
  mode, with duplicate-task protection and one-address-at-a-time validation.

### Changed

- Hardened administrator authentication, proxy handling, callback validation,
  secret redaction, and ambiguous upstream-response recovery.
- Captured structured account-creation responses from the registration worker
  and classified `registration_disallowed` as a stable policy failure instead
  of reporting it as a generic `about_you` form error.
- Split registration proxy, failure-classification, account-signal, NFapi,
  display, and form helpers into focused modules without changing API contracts.
- Reduced NFapi account state to `imported` or `not_imported`; incomplete and
  failed attempts remain session diagnostics and no longer create half-links.
- Expanded the public source distribution with the complete registration worker,
  deployment files, release checks, security policy, and third-party notices.

### Security

- Mailbox tokens, iCloud credentials, service API keys, and registration secrets
  remain server-side and encrypted at rest where persisted.
- Public examples no longer contain deployment-specific hostnames or credentials.
- Updated the web build chain, Electron runtime, and desktop packaging toolchain;
  the main AliasHub dependency audit now reports no known vulnerabilities.
