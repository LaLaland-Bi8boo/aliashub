# AliasHub

AliasHub is a self-hosted mailbox and account-operations hub for Microsoft
Outlook and Google Gmail/Workspace accounts. It keeps mailbox OAuth tokens and
service credentials on the installation that you control.

## Extended fork

This repository is an extended fork of the upstream
[1120393079/aliashub](https://github.com/1120393079/aliashub) project. It keeps
the upstream copyright notices and is distributed under the same
`AGPL-3.0-only` license.

The extended version adds and refines:

- Xunmail credential import and Graph mailbox access;
- iCloud mailbox-link import, serialized `+tag` registration, and selected
  alias-to-mailbox TXT export;
- Camoufox-based registration and reusable authenticated noVNC sessions;
- separation between the registration browser proxy and direct internal
  AliasHub mailbox traffic;
- reliable verification-code extraction from plain-text and HTML email;
- encrypted local AT backups plus official one-month Plus trial eligibility
  labels for registered accounts;
- Xunmail delivery fallback when the upstream mail response omits recipient
  metadata.

### 上游项目与致谢

本仓库是 [AliasHub](https://github.com/1120393079/aliashub) 的扩展版本，
保留原项目的版权声明，并继续遵循 GNU Affero General Public License v3.0。
本扩展主要补充了 Xunmail 邮箱接入、Camoufox 注册流程、代理隔离、内置
noVNC 会话以及验证码取件能力。

## Features

- Connect multiple Microsoft and Google source mailboxes with OAuth.
- Encrypt refresh tokens at rest with AES-256-GCM.
- Read inbox messages, extract verification codes, search mail, and export
  address inventories.
- Manage Outlook official aliases and generate repeatable `+tag` addresses.
- Run Outlook alias fill jobs through the optional Chrome/Edge connector.
- Coordinate account registration through the bundled optional registration
  worker, including browser/noVNC links and proxy selection.
- Refresh registered-account availability and plan type on demand, including
  Free, Go, Plus, Pro, Team, Business, Enterprise, Edu, Trial, and unknown
  future plans. Dynamic proxies are rechecked across independent sessions, and
  transient upstream failures preserve the last confirmed result.
- Optionally import registered accounts into one SUB2-compatible service through
  its OpenAI OAuth flow.

## What is included

This repository is the complete source distribution. It contains the AliasHub
web application and API, SQLite migrations, tests, Docker deployment files, the
Outlook browser connector, and the registration worker with its browser/noVNC
runtime under [`registration-worker/`](registration-worker/).

“Complete” refers to the supported AliasHub core and full deployment paths.
The worker retains some upstream legacy or experimental routes whose separately
developed SDKs were not published in the pinned upstream source; those routes
are not used by AliasHub registration, mailbox, dynamic-proxy, password-setup,
or optional SUB2 integration flows.

The deployment remains modular:

- **Core mode** runs AliasHub only. Mailbox OAuth, message scanning, aliases,
  address generation, verification codes, and the browser connector all work.
- **Full mode** also runs the bundled registration worker and headed browser.
  It enables automatic account registration without requiring a separately
  installed worker.

SUB2 is not a bundled service and is never required. Each deployment may connect
its own SUB2-compatible service URL and Admin API Key, or leave both empty.

## Quick start

Docker Compose is the recommended deployment path. For lightweight core mode:

```bash
./scripts/setup-local.sh
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

For the complete suite with automatic registration:

```bash
./scripts/setup-local.sh --full
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.full.yaml up -d --build
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.full.yaml ps
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4180`. The setup script prints the generated administrator
password once and stores all deployment secrets in the local `.env` file. Full
mode also binds the worker UI to `127.0.0.1:8000` and noVNC to
`127.0.0.1:6080`; neither is exposed on a public interface by default.

For native Node.js setup and remote-server deployment, see
[LOCAL-DEPLOY.md](LOCAL-DEPLOY.md).

## Development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server listens on port `5174`; the API listens on port
`4180`.

Run the verification suite before submitting a change:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
./scripts/check-public-release.sh
```

## OAuth configuration

### Microsoft

The default Microsoft public desktop client uses Authorization Code + PKCE and
requests `Mail.Read`, `User.Read`, and `offline_access`. A public desktop client
has no confidential client secret. After authorization redirects to the local
callback, paste the complete callback URL into AliasHub to finish the exchange.

Official alias creation is not available through Microsoft Graph. For automatic
official-alias fill jobs, build and load the optional connector:

```bash
npm run package:extension -- "" "http://127.0.0.1:4180"
```

The connector package does not embed its pairing key. Enter the AliasHub URL and
the installation-specific pairing key in the connector popup after loading it.

### Google

Google authorization uses Authorization Code + PKCE and requests `openid`,
`email`, `profile`, and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`.
Before binding a Google account, configure your own OAuth Client ID and Client
Secret in AliasHub settings or through the matching variables in `.env`. The
redirect URI must exactly match `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`.

Google accounts support the authenticated primary Gmail or Workspace address as
a base address for `+tag` generation. AliasHub does not create Google Workspace
administrator aliases.

## Optional SUB2-compatible service

SUB2 integration is optional and disabled until an administrator configures it.
Each AliasHub installation supports one service connection:

- Base URL of a compatible service.
- Administrator API Key for that installation's service.

Configure the connection in AliasHub settings and run the connection test. The
API Key is sent only to the AliasHub backend, encrypted before it is stored in
SQLite, and never returned to the browser. Headless deployments may instead set
`SUB2_BASE_URL` and `SUB2_ADMIN_API_KEY` as server-side environment secrets;
leave both empty by default. Do not put an API Key in source code, an image, a
release archive, or a committed `.env` file.

The integration expects the SUB2-compatible administrative API used by this
project, including the OpenAI OAuth authorization-code exchange endpoints. A
product name is not used as a compatibility check. Without this configuration,
mailbox, alias, verification-code, and registration features remain available;
only SUB2 import is unavailable.

## Data and secrets

Runtime state belongs in `.env` and `data/`; both are excluded from Git. Full
mode stores the worker database in `data/registration-worker/`. Back up `.env`
and the complete `data/` directory together. Losing `DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` makes
encrypted OAuth tokens and stored service credentials unreadable.

Never commit:

- `.env`, databases, attachments, logs, backups, or browser profiles;
- OAuth tokens, callback URLs/codes, administrator passwords, or session keys;
- connector pairing keys, registration-worker tokens, SUB2 API Keys, or proxy
  credentials;
- private deployment hostnames, addresses, or production configuration.
